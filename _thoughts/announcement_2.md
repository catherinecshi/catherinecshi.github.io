hopefully I will consistently write at some point! some ideas I have for articles

---

### Faux-advice
I'm not sure if I actually believe in the utlity of "advice", but here are some things I've learned that have worked for me

<ul>
    <li>Listen to your body the same way you listen to a child</li>
    <li>A very systematic approach to overcoming social insecurity</li>
    <li>Your ideal life probably still involves being embarassed</li>
    <li>Memories are a very good return on investment</li>
</ul>


### Philosophy

<ul>
    <li>Does metaphysical physicalism necessitate qualia being linear with neural activity?</li>
    <li>The timescale of normative consequentialism</li>
    <li>Emotional and Intellectual Understanding</li>
    <li>Mindsets do not rely on truth</li>
</ul>


### Culture
Another person talking about the same ideas, and hopefully adding quantity to things I think people should talk more about

<ul>
    <li>Will our institutions and culture ever catch up to the advancements in technology?</li>
    <li>Will sincerity ever be cool again?</li>
    <li>Do "elders" still have a role in our fast-paced world?</li>
    <li>Why aren't people nice when we all seem to think of ourselves as nice?</li>
    <li>Short-form content and the lack of cohesion in our lives</li>
    <li>Is it Men or Women's Fault? (and more importantly, what actions can we take)</li>
</ul>


### STEM
Dubious epistemic status

<ul>
    <li>Why on Earth do mathematicians care so much about geometry?</li>
    <li>What *is* energy?</li>
    <li>Strong & Weak Confirmation Bias</li>
    <li>The neuroplasticity of Love</li>
</ul>


### Art

<ul>
    <li>Everything Everywhere All at Once, and how to do Cliches well</li>
    <li>Listen to less music</li>
    <li></li>
</ul>
