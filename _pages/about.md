Hi, I'm Cat! I'm a Swift developer, cognitive neuroscientist, and fervent advocate of mala hotpot. I'm currently at a stage in my life where I'm allowing myself to bounce around different projects and regions, like living in an ambulance or trying to make the next smartphone, and I'm documenting what I've learned here. 

I'm currently still a senior at Brandeis University, majoring in neuroscience and minoring in philosophy and religious studies. Working in the [Jadhav Lab](https://jadhavlab.com/) has sparked an interest into how the brain solves the problem of information processing (and also sparked my love for rats!). My current research focuses on how imagination informs deliberative decision making, and how uncertainty may modulate this process. 

Otherwise, I'm also a big proponent of using innovative technology as a means of creating systems that promote healthy habits. With this idea in mind, I am working on an app that automates the habit tracking process of users, helping them shape their environment and create systems to best habituate their actions. Though the app is still in development, you can sign up to be on the waitlist [here](https://www.rightnowtech.org/).

In my free time, I really have fun when solo travelling, playing the piano, or when I'm learning new things! I'm usually working through a syllabus of a topic I want to learn more about, and I'm currently reading about [Chinese politics](https://chatgpt.com/share/673767d6-f6a4-8006-9eba-66558aca62cd). I'm also a really big fan of the [foundational assumptions of effective altruism](https://open.substack.com/pub/astralcodexten/p/effective-altruism-as-a-tower-of?r=1unmfe&selection=b9a168e3-234f-41c9-8974-f246e9713e77&utm_campaign=post-share-selection&utm_medium=web), and I worked as the Vice President of [Brandeis Effective Altruism](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/groups/WS7hnkF3SBHGj43Y7) for two years.
