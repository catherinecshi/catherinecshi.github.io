Hi, I'm Cat! I'm a Swift developer, cognitive neuroscientist, and fervent advocate of mala hotpot. I'm currently at a stage in my life where I'm allowing myself to bounce around different projects and regions, like living in an ambulance or trying to make the next smartphone, and I'm documenting what I've learned here. 

I'm currently still a senior at Brandeis University, majoring in neuroscience and minoring in philosophy and religious studies. Working in the [Jadhav Lab](https://jadhavlab.com/) has sparked an interest into how the brain solves the problem of information processing (and also my love for rats!). My current research focuses on how imagination informs deliberative decision making, and how uncertainty may modulate this process. 

Otherwise, I'm also a big proponent of using innovative technology as a means of creating systems that promote healthy habits. With this idea in mind, I am working on an app that automates the habit tracking process of users, helping them shape their environment and create systems to best habituate their actions. 

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
